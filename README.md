# What's KineticJS

[http://www.kineticjs.com](KineticJS)

Greetings fellow webonauts! KineticJS is an HTML5 Canvas JavaScript library that extends the 2d context by enabling canvas interactivity for desktop and mobile applications.

You can draw your own shapes or images using the existing canvas API, add event listeners to them, move them, scale them, and rotate them independently from other shapes to support high performance animations, even if your application uses thousands of shapes.  Served hot with a side of awesomeness.
